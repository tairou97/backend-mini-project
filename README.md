# Bookshelf API

## Phase 1: Planning and Design

Objectives:

* Understand the project requirements.

* Design the API endpoints.

* Gather Data.

Tasks:

1. Define the scope of the bookshelf API (e.g., adding books, retrieving book details, updating book information, deleting books).

1.Sketch the API endpoints and their methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

1.Plan the database schema for books (consider fields like title, author, ISBN, and publication year).

## Phase 2: Setting Up the Environment

Objectives:

* Set up the development environment.

* Initialize the project with version control.

Tasks:

1. Install necessary packages.

1. Initialize a new Git repository and commit the initial project structure.

1. Create a basic README file with project description(You will need it later).

## Phase 3: Building the Database Layer

Objectives:

* Implement the database schema.

* Learn about Atlas and Render.com.

Tasks:

1. Set up the database and create a connection from the application.

1. Define models/migrations for the book data structure.

1. Implement simple CRUD operations for the database models.

## Phase 4: Developing the API Endpoints

Objectives:

* Implement RESTful principles.

* Handle HTTP requests and responses.

* Understand middleware and routing in web frameworks.

Tasks:

1. Set up routes for each API endpoint.

1. Implement controllers for handling business logic for each route.

1. Ensure proper status codes and responses are returned.

## Phase 5: Adding Authentication

Objectives:

* Implement basic authentication.

* Understand the concept of middleware for protecting routes.

Tasks:

1. Set up user registration and login endpoints.

1. Implement authentication based on what you have learned.

1. Protect book-related routes with authentication checks.

## Phase 6: Testing

Objectives:

* Learn basic unit and integration testing for APIs.

* Use testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha.

Tasks:

1. Write tests for each endpoint to ensure they behave as expected.

1. Test error handling and edge cases.

1. Ensure database operations are performed correctly.

## Phase 7: Documentation and Deployment

Objectives:

* Document the API for future developers.

* Learn basic deployment to a cloud provider(Atlas, Render.com).

Tasks:

1. Document each endpoint, including parameters and example requests/responses.

1. Prepare the application for deployment (consider environment variables, database connections).

1. Deploy the API to a cloud provider like Render, and ensure it's accessible.


## Bonus

* Code Reviews: Review a peer's code and provide feedback on quality and improvement.

* Continuous Integration: Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
